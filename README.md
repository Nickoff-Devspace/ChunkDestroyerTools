## Recipes

### Packed Blocks

The source material for building these tools are the Packed Blocks. A packed block is always crafted putting 9 blocks of the specific material for each tier into the crafting table.

#### Available materials for packed blocks:

- Logs
- Stone
- Iron Block
- Gold Block
- Diamond Block
- Netherite Block

### Chunk Tools

After crafting these blocks, you'll be able to craft your chunk tools. All chunk tools use the same crafting shape as Minecraft default tools, only differing the material used to build them.
